# Runtime Debugging. ...
 When you are debugging a program at runtime, it's extremely useful to be able to examine<br /> the state of your program at runtime, set breakpoints, and execute pieces of<br />  it down to the single-statement level in a controlled way.<br /> 

Runtime error detection can identify defects that manifest themselves only at runtime <br /> (for example, file overwrites) and zeroing in on the root causes of the application <br /> crashing, running slowly, or behaving unpredictably. Defects commonly detected by<br />  runtime error detection include:<br /> 

- Race conditions
- Exceptions
- Resource leaks
- Memory leaks
- Security attack vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection)
- Null pointers
- Uninitialised memory
- Buffer overflows
